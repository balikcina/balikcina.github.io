Denying it the all-important two-thirds majority in Parliament and the control of five states has certainly made the political scenario more vibrant.\u003Cbr\u003EAlthough surprised that there was such power in the vote they cast, Malaysians woke up to the true meaning and practice of democracy.

Bawani (pic) was neither an ordinary student nor a political novice, as she was associated with Parti Sosialis Malaysia (PSM) and had actively participated in anti-government rallies.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhile berating Bawani for using the forum to deliver a politically-motivated speech instead of asking questions, pro-Barisan Nasional bloggers also criticised forum panellist Sharifah Zohra Syed Shah Miskin for talking down to the student.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe 24-minute video clip showed Sharifah Zohra chiding Bawani after the latter kept talking about free education even though the panellist had told her to stop during “Forum Suara Mahasiswa Part 4”.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe video, which was uploaded last week, had become the subject of parody and songs, taking a dig at Sharifah Zohra’s now infamous “listen, listen, listen, listen”.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENetizens had been firing salvos at Sharifah Zohra, who is president of Suara Wanita 1Malaysia (SW1M) yesterday.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOn the Facebook “We are All Bawani”, Noor Azlan M.

But she is a supporter of our party,” he said.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EYesterday, in an interview with China Press, Bawani said her idol was Che Guevara, the late Argentinian Marxist revolutionary and guerilla leader who became a symbol of rebellion.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESharifah Zohra claimed that SW1M was being used as a “black sheep” to divert attention from Pakatan Rakyat’s unsuccessful Himpunan Kebangkitan Rakyat rally that failed to attract one million protesters.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EUUM vice-chancellor Datuk Prof Dr Mohamed Mustafa Ishak said Bawani had not contravened university rules although she was actively involved in political activities.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“Students are allowed to join political parties as long as they do not bring partisan politics to campus,” he said, adding that Bawani lost in a recent campus polls.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe university was aware of Bawani’s participation in rallies such as Bersih and Himpunan Kebangkitan Rakyat, said Dr Mustafa, who also distanced the university from Sharifah Zohra.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“She (Sharifah Zohra) has nothing to do with UUM or the Government.

None of us expected it to this extent. But despite the extent of the swing against us, BN did not fall,” he added.\u003Cbr\u003EAt a separate press conference, PR de facto leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said the pact rejected the results of the poll, pointing to unanswered allegations on electoral fraud.\u003Cbr\u003E“As of now, we are not accepting the results... until the EC (Election Commission) responds and issues an official statement to the allegations of irregularities and fraud,” he told reporters.\u003Cbr\u003EAs at 12.50am this morning, BN retained federal power with a simple majority, scoring 112 seats to PR’s

Several Muslims have argued, especially after former Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad's declaration that Malaysia is an Islamic state, that Malaysia is in actual fact an Islamic state. One Member of Parliament (MP), Badruddin bin Amiruldin, has stated in the Dewan Rakyat house of Parliament that \"Malaysia ini negara Islam\" (\"Malaysia is an Islamic state\") and that \"you tidak suka, you keluar dari Malaysia!\" (\"You don't like it, you get out of Malaysia!\") Badruddin refused to take back his statement, and a motion to refer him to the House Committee of Privileges was rejected by a voice vote. [4] However, the first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, contradicted this stance in the 1980s, saying, \"All talk on Islamic States is just an empty dream.

","source":"KUALA LUMPUR, April 15 — Malaysia’s civil law and shariah systems are not parallels, Datuk Zaid Ibrahim said today when criticising “weak” Muslim leaders for perpetuating the “false” view that has led to controversial interfaith child custody disputes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe former de facto law minister lambasted Muslim leaders in both the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition and opposition pact Pakatan Rakyat (PR) for their hypocrisy, saying neither were willing to admit that Malaysia was founded as a secular democracy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAt the same time, however, he said they also refused to openly embrace an Islamic theocracy for fear of losing their privileges.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“These Muslim leaders are a weak bunch, fearful of being honest with the people because what’s paramount for them is holding the seat of power,” Zaid wrote on his blog, zaid.my, yesterday.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“The people should realise that they have been fooled for a long time, and must now collectively stand up and be counted. We cannot live with this charade forever,” he added.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EZaid stressed that Shariah laws in the country are applicable to Muslims only in “selected matters”.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“Personal laws for Muslims are part of the main system and they are not meant to override the main body of laws in the country. Yet no one is prepared to publicly declare that the civil High Court is the superior court under the Constitution,” he said.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“It’s illogical to say we have two systems coexisting in parity when they are totally different in scope and power. Our civil courts must be able to make a ruling to determine if the Shariah Court has applied the law correctly; otherwise, what we get is the chaos we are seeing today,” added Zaid, who had served as de facto law minister in the Abdullah administration.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe boundaries between the civil and Shariah court's jurisdictions have been blurred recently again with a bitter child custody dispute between a Hindu woman and her estranged Muslim convert husband.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOn April 7, the Seremban High Court had granted S. Deepa full custody of her two children ― a nine-year-old daughter and a six-year-old son ― with N. Viran who later embraced Islam after they got married.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe ruling said the couple’s marriage was a civil union and was outside the jurisdiction of the Shariah courts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut 48 hours after losing the custody dispute in the civil court, Viran ― who was earlier granted child custody by the Shariah court ― took their son from outside his estranged wife’s house in Jelebu, Negri Sembilan.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe police have refused to act on the Hindu mother’s abduction report against the child’s father, with Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar citing the two conflicting court orders as the reason.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EZaid said yesterday that if “weak Muslim leaders” in peninsular Malaysia really want to elevate shariah above everything else, they should amend the Federal Constitution and declare unequivocally that Islamic laws are the foundation of all laws.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“Then the Shariah Court will be superior to the High Court. We might not even need the High Court by then. It would then also be opportune to declare that the Quran is the highest law of the land and that the Federal Constitution is subject to it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“At least then we would know where we stand. These leaders must not be allowed to continue confusing everybody, including our policemen,” said the outspoken politician.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EZaid also criticised the police for saying that a father could not possibly abduct his own son.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“This same policeman will one day say that a husband could not possibly rape his wife, or that any sexual crime requires four witnesses, regardless of what the law says,” he said.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn the Seremban case, Viran — who has adopted the Muslim name, Izwan Abdullah — managed to convert his children to Islam last year without his wife's knowledge, despite a Cabinet decision in 2009 prohibiting children from being converted to Islam without the consent of both parents.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA committee under Datuk Seri Mohamed Nazri Aziz, who was de facto law minister then, had proposed amendments to the Law Reform (Marriage and Divorces) Act and the Federal Territory Islamic Enactment to protect minors from being converted to Islam, but five years on, the amendments have yet to be tabled in Parliament.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIslam is listed in the constitution as the religion of the federation, but some including former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad interpret this to mean that Malaysia is an Islamic state.\u003Cbr\u003E- See more at: http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/zaid-malaysia-does-not-have-dual-legal-system#sthash.MyiTC9Q6.dpuf","created_at":"2014-04-20T17:49:00.891Z","updated_at":"2014-04-26T15:25:53.142Z","source_url":"http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/zaid-malaysia-does-not-have-dual-legal-system","source_date":"2014-04-15","context":"","view_count":33,"accepted":true,"submitted_by":"balikcina","submitted_by_email":"info@balikcina.com","player_name":"Zaid Ibrahim","tags":[],"player":{"id":48,"created_at":"2014-04-20T16:45:20.932Z","updated_at":"2014-04-20T16:45:20.932Z","name":"Zaid Ibrahim","avatar_file_name":null,"avatar_content_type":null,"avatar_file_size":null,"avatar_updated_at":null,"avatar_url":"http://www.kualalumpurpost.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/zaid-ibrahim.jpg","description":"Dato' Mohd Zaid Ibrahim is a prominent Malaysian lawyer turned politician and is a former Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of legal affairs and judicial reform.","tags":[]}},{"id":189,"player_id":41,"quote":"Censor the Internet so China won't get mad","source":"KUALA LUMPUR, March 25 — Putrajaya must restrict information on the Internet about Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 to protect Malaysians from the rage of Chinese families who lost their relatives to the doomed plane, Datuk Bung Mokhtar Radin said today.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAccording to the Kinabatangan MP, continued bad news about the plane that is now assumed lost with no survivors among the 239 people on board could move Chinese citizens to take out their anger on Malaysians abroad.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“With our uncontrolled media, everything can be uploaded to their heart’s content.

said one of the most important problems faced by Muslims at this time is the \"ghazwul fikri\" or \"mind colonisation\" which links to the different lives of people.\u003Cbr\u003E\"This theory on

the young people,\" it said.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe religious body called on Muslims to \"look forward positively\" in order to shape their identity as Muslims who can be viewed as examples for others.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis issue, it said, came up because Muslims have strayed far from Allah and the Prophet's teachings, with some even abandoning them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“In the end, there are people now who cannot differentiate the truth and falsehood,” the sermon said.\u003Cbr\u003EThe sermon also called on Muslims to stay away from:

Western culture.”\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOn Wednesday, after launching the “Mind the Valentine’s Day Trap” campaign, Datuk Wan Mohamad Sheikh Abdul Aziz, director-general of Jakim, said Islam had

our love for our parents.\u003Cbr\u003E“At the same time, however, Islam would reject anything, even from the Eastern culture, if it contravenes Islamic teachings,” he added.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe said Islam does not oppose the celebration of love, but immoral activities that usually take place coinciding with the celebration.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“That is why a fatwa (edict) was issued to prevent and advise Muslims not to celebrate Valentine’s Day because in reality, as well as historically, the celebration of Valentine’s Day is synonymous with immoral activities,” he said.\u003Cbr\u003EThe fatwa, issued by the National Fatwa Council during its 71st conference almost six years ago, stated

But Tanda Putera also shows how a Chinese family helps protect their Malay friends and Malay youths protecting their non-Malay friends from rioters. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E“More importantly, it shows how Malaysians managed to overcome the horror of May 13th to bring back the peace and stability which we enjoy to this day.
